# AI-Generated Mini Game Project 🎮✨

**Created with AI-Powered Tools & Code Editors**​  
*Last Updated: Jan 1, 2025*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This browser-based multiplayer flying game was developed in ​**3 hours**​ using cutting-edge AI tools and code editors, demonstrating the revolutionary potential of AI-assisted game development[2,5](@ref). Inspired by the success story of Pieter Levels' _Fly.pieter_ that earned $17,360 in 9 days[2,4,5](@ref), this project showcases how modern AI tools dramatically lower the barrier to game creation.

## ✨ Key Features
- ​**🛩️ AI-Crafted Core Mechanics**​  
  Flight physics and collision detection algorithms generated by [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with GPT-4.7[5,8](@ref), achieving 10x faster development than traditional coding.

- ​**🌐 Real-Time Multiplayer**​  
  Server synchronization powered by Grok-3's AI-generated network code[2,5](@ref), updating player positions 10 times/sec.

- ​**🎨 AI-Generated Assets**​  
  All visual elements (planes, environments) created using [Leonardo.AI](https://leonardo.ai) from text prompts like _"retro pixel art fighter jet with rusted metal texture"_[2,8](@ref).

- ​**🤖 Self-Optimizing Gameplay**​  
  Dynamic difficulty adjustment via Claude 3.7 analysis of player behavior patterns[5,8](@ref).
